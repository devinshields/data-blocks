experimental: transform notebook research results into web-sharable knowledge blocks


### intro

* notebooks are an awesome tool for fast, interactive research.
* but once I've hacked on some data and discovered something useful,
* I don't know a good way to freeze that example and publish my results on the web.


### inspiration

* the python world **does** have the ipython notebook viewer
  * but the lack of a building block standard makes finding
  * and re-using code slow and unreliable
  
* a major difference I've noticed when working with notebooks is
  * that the graph, or image, or whatever is intersting there is "below the fold". Data folks need to
  * get better at making and **web-sharing executive-summary versions** of our researh.
  
* I'm looking more towards [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) and
  * the awesome open source community that builds d3.sj


## long term, I want solutions for:

* how to correctly export notebooks for the web (and make sharing NPI safe)

* where to deploy/host a researh building block

* setting the right tone and level of formality
  * create templates & examples for knowledge build blocks
  * include placeholders for stages of the scientific method

* help users to be explicit about what their work is testing
  * or if their research is not goal oriented, to talk
  * about the what and why of their exploration


## short term, I want to:


### transform a notebook

* into a web accessable building block of knowledge,
* without screwing up the primary repository the notebook lives in.


## make a typical notebook

and do a typical firt-pass on some data.

* do a getting-to-know-you", type scan over the data:
  * look at a sample
  * look at available metadata
  * basic counts
  * basic plots
